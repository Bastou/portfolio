    I was searching for a solution to avoid some dumb repetitions at the beginning of a website project. Whether I create without a base or retrieve code I had already done before, I was always wasting time. I wanted to have a simple and flexible project base with only the components that I need. I came up with the idea to merge the great possibilities of the css pre-processor SASS and the power of Yeoman to give a helping hand to the start up of projects.
