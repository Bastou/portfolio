This large-scale project included some interesting challenges such as the management of a social wall – one for the entire website et one for each ski stations where users can share their experience in the mountains through Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.      The density and the diversity of informations on the website required a lot of different styled modules.</description>

      <description>The app was created with hybrid html5 with Cordova. This allowed me to combine the flexibility of Html5 and some native features like GPS location, adding events to the calendar and sharing on social networks.

      <description>One interesting aspect in this project was the use of a video on the home page which continues to run behind each main sections of the website.

      <description>I was searching for a solution to avoid some dumb repetitions at the beginning of a website project. Whether I create without a base or retrieve code I had already done before, I was always wasting time. I wanted to have a simple and flexible project base with only the components that I need. I came up with the idea to merge the great possibilities of the css pre-processor SASS and the power of Yeoman to give a helping hand to the start up of projects.</description>
